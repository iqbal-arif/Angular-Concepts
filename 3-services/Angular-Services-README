#**\*\***\***\*\*** Angular Services Setup **\*\***\***\*\***#

1. git link
   https://github.com/angular-university/angular-course/tree/3-services

2. git checkout -b 2-services origin/2-directives.

3. npm update

4. npm start

5. For Backup API Server: in second Terminal start : npm run server
   This will allow to query Backend and display query on the screen using angular HTTP service

#**\*\***\***\*\*** Angular HTTP Client Services **\*\***\***\*\***#

1. Connecting Database Through HTTP Client Services constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
2. Using ngOnInit Life-cycle Hooks to Initialize logic, such as, triggering Backend Call to fetch Data for component
3. This ngOnInit method is called by Angular Framework
4. Adding parameters to Http get request via Angular HttpParams utility
   const params = new HttpParams().set("page", "1").set("pageSize", "10");
5. Adding parameters to Http get request via Angular HttpParams utility
   const params = new HttpParams().set("page", "1").set("pageSize", "10");
6. http.get gives unobservable. To display the content use .subscribe() method
7. Adding request parameters from params constant
   this.http.get("/api/courses", { params })

#**\*\***\***\*\*** Angular Async Pipe **\*\***\***\*\***#

1. Async Pipe allows implicitly subscribe to observable from the template
2. Without Async the observable are derived manually and are mutable
3. Define Observable annotation: courses$: Observable<Course[]>;
4. Fetch the Params Values: this.courses$ = this.http.get<Course[]>("/api/courses", { params });
5. Reference to App View Template:
   <course-card \*ngFor="let course of courses$ | async" [course]="course">
   1. Once course value arrives from API it will be displayed to Template view ngcontent utility

#**\*\***\***\*\*** Custom Angular Services **\*\***\***\*\***#

1. Generate service template with Injectable Class that can inject services just like Angular built-in injectable service.
   ng generate service services/courses
2. Injectable Service: Compatible with Angular Dependency Injection System.
   @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
   1. Means it can create only one an instance of the service available for the whole App at the root of the dependency injector.
3. Class AppComponent does not create its own HTTP Client dependencies. It is provided via constructor function of the Class AppComponent.
   Class does not know
   1. Where does it exists , how is it implemented, and
   2. Is it a test implementation or is it a real HTTP Client.
   3. But it knows that dependencies are injected via constructor called dependency injection.
4. Injecting class CoursesService to App (APPLICATION SINGLETON Means only one INSTANCE.)
   1. Define coursesService:CoursesService with type annotation to inject an instance of course in App
      constructor(
      private http: HttpClient,
      private coursesService: CoursesService ) {}
   2. Injecting coursesService Instance at Component Level
      constructor(private coursesService: CoursesService) {}
   3. Logging coursesService Instance at Component Level
      ngOnInit() {console.log("coursesService course card", this.coursesService);}
   4. Logging to verify that it is the only one instance available in all cards
      constructor() { console.log("creating CoursesServices");}
5. Angular Custom Service Fetching Data. Common Shared Service Logical Approach
   1. To use HTTP Fetch Service in Several Components of the application other than Application itself
   2. Move all HTTP logic to one central courses.service allowing to call multiple parts of App
      export class CoursesService {
      Define private service to utilize HTTP Client Services
      constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
   3. Data is returned via Observable loadCourses()
      loadCourses(): Observable<Course[]> {
      const params = new HttpParams().set("page", "1").set("pageSize", "10");
      this.http.get("/api/courses", { params });
      return this.http.get<Course[]>("/api/courses", { params }); }
   4. When Data is available it emits and receive it by App's observable
      courses$: Observable<Course[]>
6. Angular Custom Services : Data Modification Method PUT
   1. Define API service:
      saveCourse(course:Course){ }
   2. Call API from App Component : @Output("courseChanged")
   3. Detect course change event that will emit the course
      onSaveClicked(description: string) {this.courseEmitter.emit({ ...this.course, description });}
   4. Subscribe to course: <course-card \*ngFor="let course of courses" (courseChanged="save($event)") [course]="course">
   5. Save the modification coming through changed event
      save(course:Course){}
   6. Add Custom HTTP header to Request for server to verify if operation is allowed or not

#**\*\***\***\*\*** Angular Dependencies System **\*\***\***\*\***#

1. AppComponent has Defined Injection Dependencies of coursesService:CoursesService with type annotation to inject an instance of course via class constructor function
   constructor( private coursesService: CoursesService)
   Note: The component class itself does not know how to create its dependency.
2. Each course service can have its own dependencies injected to the constructor
   such as, in course.service.ts we have HttpClient Angular-builtin dependency
   constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
3. The dependency injection system has multiple advantages
   1. Easier to test for
      a. actual service connecting to the Backend fetching data, or
      b. Test for mock test implementation.
   2. Building UI with a lot of nested components and dependency services caters it.
4. The course service is not instantiating by class but injected by Angular.
   The provider helps in generating the instances of the class course
   It creates the dependency on behalf of the Angular Dependency injection system.
   a. Provider give angular dependency injection a factory function to create dependency
   b. Angular dependency system call factory function to generate dependency
   c. Passes as services on to various components of App via constructor function
   The provider is also know as Tree-shakeable provider
   @Injectable({
   providedIn: "root",
   })

5. Creating Angular Dependencies Provider Manually to inject CoursesService dependencies
   NOte: This is just to understand how provider works under the hood, but normally it is not required to create your own.

#**\*\***\***\*\*** Angular Default Change Detection **\*\***\***\*\***#

1. Angular scans through each component tree check for [value] inputs changes after every event listed in the template, such as, click event or keyup event.
2. If expressions have changed it is going to update the view.

#**\*\***\***\*\*** Angular OnPush Change Detection **\*\***\***\*\***#

1. If component is using an OnPush detection, then
   a. Angular will not try to detect changes on the @Input() data by analyzing each of the expressions of the template.

   b. Instead, Angular is going to try to detect changes in the @Input() over the component.

   c. In Default Detection , Angular checks all the expressions fo all the templates in the component hierarchy when any event occurs.

   d. With OnPush Detection, when @Input() data of any given branch of the component has not changed then Angular skips the entire branch.
   For an Example: if card component has child components, those child components would not be checked for change detection if the course component did not have itself some changes pass to it.
   Whole component branch get bypassed.

   e. For @Input() data; JS objects are being compared that gets passed by object reference. As long @Input() data is get mutated by any other components, such as, parent component. So use immutable Objects TO Avoid this situation.

   f. OnPush Detection does not hold memory slot in PC. Apparently faster but tricker.

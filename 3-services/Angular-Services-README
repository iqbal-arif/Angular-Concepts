#************* Angular Services Setup *************#

1. git link
   https://github.com/angular-university/angular-course/tree/3-services

2. git checkout -b 2-services origin/2-directives.

3. npm update

4. npm start

5. For Backup API Server: in second Terminal start : npm run server
This will allow to query Backend and display query on the screen using angular HTTP service

#************* Angular HTTP Client Services *************#
1. Connecting Database Through HTTP Client Services constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
2. Using ngOnInit Life-cycle Hooks to Initialize logic, such as, triggering Backend Call to fetch Data for component
3. This ngOnInit method is called by Angular Framework
4. Adding parameters to Http get request via Angular HttpParams utility
   const params = new HttpParams().set("page", "1").set("pageSize", "10");
5. Adding parameters to Http get request via Angular HttpParams utility
    const params = new HttpParams().set("page", "1").set("pageSize", "10");
6. http.get gives unobservable. To display the content use .subscribe() method
7. Adding request parameters from params constant
    this.http.get("/api/courses", { params }) 


#************* Angular Async Pipe *************#
1. Async Pipe allows implicitly subscribe to observable from the template
2. Without Async the observable are derived manually and are mutable
3. Define Observable annotation: courses$: Observable<Course[]>;
4. Fetch the Params Values: this.courses$ = this.http.get<Course[]>("/api/courses", { params });
5. Reference to App View Template:
   <course-card *ngFor="let course of courses$ | async" [course]="course">
   1. Once course value arrives from API it will be displayed to Template view ngcontent utility


#************* Custom Angular Services *************#
1. Generate service template with Injectable Class that can inject services just like Angular built-in injectable service.
ng generate service services/courses
2. Injectable Service: Compatible with Angular Dependency Injection System.
   @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
   1. Means it can create only one an instance of the service available for the whole App at the root of the dependency injector.
3. Class AppComponent does not create its own HTTP Client dependencies. It is provided via constructor function  of the Class AppComponent.
   Class does not know
   1. Where does it exists , how is it implemented, and
   2. Is it a test implementation or is it a real HTTP Client.
   3. But it knows that dependencies are injected via constructor called dependency injection.
4. Injecting class CoursesService to App  (APPLICATION SINGLETON Means only one INSTANCE.)
   1. Define coursesService:CoursesService with type annotation to inject an instance of course in App
      constructor(
      private http: HttpClient,
      private coursesService: CoursesService ) {} 
   2. Injecting coursesService Instance at Component Level
      constructor(private coursesService: CoursesService) {}
   3. Logging coursesService Instance at Component Level
      ngOnInit() {console.log("coursesService course card", this.coursesService);}
   4. Logging to verify that it is the only one instance available in all cards
      constructor() { console.log("creating CoursesServices");}
